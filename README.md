# BCG_project_feature_engineering

Feature Engineering Notebook

Problem Statement:

"As a Junior Data Scientist at BCG X, you are tasked with investigating a customer churn problem for a client, PowerCo. PowerCo suspects that price sensitivity is driving their customers to switch providers, and you need to leverage data science techniques to solve this challenge. The problem involves analyzing and cleaning real-world datasets, engineering features, building predictive models, and translating insights into actionable business recommendations.

Your objective is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn, predict future churn behavior, and provide strategic recommendations to PowerCo that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention." (According to Forage problem statement)

What I Did:

Imported the template file provided by the Forage team and created new features by extracting date-time information (e.g., extracting day, month, or weekday from date columns) to enhance predictive capabilities.

Tools Used:

Python

Libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy for numerical operations.

Scikit-learn for machine learning tools, including preprocessing and feature selection.

Recommendations:

By solving this project one can enhance their expertise in libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn. Mastering these will help to tackle more complex datasets and models.
Experiment with advanced techniques such as PCA for dimensionality reduction and non-linear transformations for better feature creation and model performance.

Conclusion:

This experience has strengthened your core data science skills, from data cleaning to feature engineering and model building. You’ve learned how to transform raw data into actionable insights, which is critical in data science. The hands-on work with Python, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling has solidified your technical foundation. Moving forward, deepening your knowledge of advanced modeling techniques and improving communication with business teams will help you become more impactful. This experience has equipped you with the tools to solve complex problems and drive data-driven decisions.
